# WebCrawler
A simple web crawler project

This is a simple web crawler targeted at most popular Chinese movies rating website Douban.com. Currently it reads the names and downloads the cover pictures of the top 25 movies with highest ratings.

It now saves pictures to local folder. But in the futures, I plan to make it store everything directly to MongoDB.
